Today I am trying something new. I am writing down my thoughts in a blog, and as somebody who has always struggled to translate their thoughts into words, this will be a unique challenge for me.

When I was younger, I had trouble with spelling and vocabulary. My fellow classmates' reading ability was always just a little bit ahead of my own. Do you remember when teachers would call on random students, or go around the class and have everyone read a passage aloud? I can almost feel the anxiety all over again. Struggling to pronounce words in front of the entire class was awfully embarrassing, so instead of paying attention I would skip ahead to see if there were any words coming up that I couldn’t pronounce.

“What is wrong with me?” I constantly asked myself. People would call me a late bloomer, but I’m not sure if that helped me feel any better. Late bloomer was their polite way of saying that I was a little behind.

My frustration led me to resist learning what was being taught in school, so I felt a desire to do something creative for a living, like being a comic book writer or an animator.

While I have come a long way and can reflect on all of this time now, I have gained a new perspective on my challenges. Perhaps my challenges focusing were because I was just not interested in the things that were being taught, or the way the material was presented. The learning structures within schools are not one size fits all. Some students might benefit with a more hands on approach. Otherwise, wandering minds are going to drift off into a more fascinating world outside of the cold white brick walls of within the classroom.

**Nicholas Alex** is a freelance Web Developer from [Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orlando), Florida. After receiving a Bachelor's degree in Film and Digital Media from the University of Central Florida, he had a few odd jobs not related to his degree. Most were mind-numbing work with little to no creativity. After speaking to some friends in the tech field, Nick decided to start teaching himself HTML, CSS and JavaScript at home. A couple weeks later, he finally took a break to eat and shower and now he knows what he wants to do for a living.

Nick graduated from a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp out of UCF's continuing education program. He is currently working on freelance projects for small businesses and personal projects to gain more experience and is currently seeking employment in the industry. He hopes to influence others like him that are just starting out by posting his experiences in this blog.

As a hobby, Nick also likes to cross stitch, make bread, take photos of insects, and create music. He lives in the Orlando area with his partner Jen and pug Simon.
